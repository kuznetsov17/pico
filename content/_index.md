This is the index page of **minimal-dark** (not only dark nowadays) zola theme.
It was designed to serve small v-card site with [blogging](notes) section.

The theme was created keeping in mind the [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) approach. Feel free to fork, modify or completely deface :)
